:::tip

Note that `adPresented` value remains `true` after the ad is dismissed. The value changes to `false` when ad is initialized via `load()`. Also, `adDismissed` value remains `true` until new ad is presented even if after a new ad is loaded. To determine whether the ad is showing, use `adShowing` value.
