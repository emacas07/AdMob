:::tip

Note that `adPresented` value remains `true` after the ad is dismissed.
The value changes to `false` when ad is initialized via `load()`.
To determine whether the ad is showing, use `adShowing` value.

:::

:::caution

When using with `loadOnDismissed` option to `true`, changed `adDimissed` and `reward` value will appear for a very short time and initialized to `false` and `undefined` respectively as derived states are initialized just after new ad is requested.
